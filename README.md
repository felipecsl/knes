## Building/Running

You'll need to pull the oboe git submodule to run ktnes:
```
git submodule init && git submodule update
```

## Android implementation

You should be able to build and run directly from Android Studio.
From the command line:
```
./gradlew android:installDebug
```

## Javascript implementation

To build/run the Javascript version of the emulator, run `./gradlew web:run`
Then, open `http://localhost:8088` on your browser.

## Status

Still under active development.

Sound works but is still a bit garbled/distorted.

### Implemented mappers:

* Mapper 0
* Mapper 1
* Mapper 4 (MMC3)
